# BudgetWise

BudgetWise is a full-stack budgeting app that lets users record expenses, organize them by category, and view spending summaries. Users can record daily expenses, categorize them, and instantly see how much they’ve spent this month. The app provides an intuitive dashboard where users can set monthly budgets, track income versus expenses, and monitor their financial goals over time. A reminder feature notifies users of upcoming due dates so they stay on top of payments.

**Core Features**

- **User Authentication:** Users create an account and securely login/logout.
- **Dashboard:** Summary of all utilities, how many are paid, due, or upcoming. Shows how much has been spent compared to each user-defined budget. Allows the user to add a utility service with default due date, amount, and notes. Users can update bill details or edit the service defaults (due dates, amounts, etc.).
- **Budget Management:** Set and manage specific spending limits by category (e.g. Food, Housing) and time period (start and end dates.) Create, view, and delete multiple category-specific budgets.
- **Reminders:** Send reminders before due dates and on the due date.
- **Add/Edit/Delete Transactions:** Record income or expense transactions (title, amount, category, date).
- **History & Search:** Show prior months' bills with filters for quick lookups. Search by provider, account number, or tags. Filter by month and status.
